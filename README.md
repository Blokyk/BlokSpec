# BlokSpec

## Introduction

This document is a draft for the theorical Blok Specification. It is organized as the [csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) repo. It's not really meant *for* open source, but if you any suggestions, open an issue or a PR and i'll review it. Plus, I find it way easier that way, and it's more pratical for me.
